# CMPG323CV
Project 1: Online CV code
To run the project:
 npm install --save node
 npm install --save emailjs-com
 npm run build
 npm run start

I tried to make a final commit today to finish up my project and totally messed up my original Git repo.
 I have tried to fix it but have had to resort to using a new repo. Im sorry that it does not show my continuous development towards the project.
